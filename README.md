# TurboSpeed - Infinite Scrolling Racing Game

# Project Overview
TurboSpeed is an engaging and addictive arcade-style infinite scrolling racing game developped with Python and the Pygame library.

In TurboSpeed, the player controls a car speeding down a dynamically-scrolling road, with the objective of avoiding boulders for as long as possible. As time goes on, the car moves faster and faster, thus increasing the difficulty.

Down below, you can see a screenshot of the gameplay.
